Name of Program = Pong

Program Features
*Basic Game Implementation 

*Multiple Balls - Program supports multiple balls. Ball struct. Stored in an array of Balls.
				  New ball spawned every few hits of paddle. This uses the spawn ball 
				  method to spawn a new ball. 

*Rewards - One of the powerups spawns another ball.

		 - One of the powerups increases the paddle length back to max length.

*Traps - One of the powerups destroys one of the current balls. If only 1 ball remains a life 
		 is lost.

	   - One of the powerups moves the ball position to a random location.

	   - One of the powerups decreases the paddle to it's minimum length. 


Program Problems
*Although all powerups work as stated the randomness of them chosen seems to be heavily weighted towards the destroy ball and spawn ball powerups. 

*For powerup struct needed to declare the array of strings for the powerup names outside of struct or else the program crashes.
